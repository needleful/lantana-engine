Name Ideas:
I like Kitty, though it's just a nickname.  I should figure out her real name.  Kayang ('Hazel' in Doongar) is a good one.

Boto should have a better name.  Ideas from Noongar words:

	Boya: Rocks, stones
	Bardan: Spirit
	Bokitja: Going a long way
	Bo: A long way
	Koitj/Kodja: Axe
	Meeuk: Moon
	Mulgar: Thunder
	Wardan: Ocean, sea
	Warlang: Healthy

Boto is now named "Bardan"

Noongar names:
	Jubaitch

Kitty: this is kitty

Bardan: It works! So we can talk through this when you're on missions?

Kitty: i can send messages to yo, but phones arent meant to send messages into space

Kitty: *you 

Bardan: Wait, so how are you receiving these?

Kitty: the reciever works on the ground

Kitty: but once we launch, the only way to send messages to us is by central command.

Bardan: So once you're in space, you won't see any of these...

Kitty: Yeah.

Kitty: but i can send them. the transmitter's strong enough

Bardan: That sucks.

Bardan: I mean, it's nice that you can send updates,

Bardan: But you know.

Kitty: if it makes you feel better, you can e-mail cencom and th3'

Kitty: they'll pass it along with their usual payload

Bardan: It's something, at least.

Bardan: Do you think they'll check for messages often?

Bardan: Those guys didn't keep me in the loop before.

Bardan: So i Don't know 

Kitty: you've got a point.  they could be slow to pass it on.

Bardan, the ship exploded

i think the engine went critical

how does that even happen on a modern god dam space ship

whatever, thats not important now

point is, the ship blew up

im not hurt or anything. i was thrown out and i;m sort of floating here

we were really far out.




i cant tell if im moving away from the ship or the ship is moving away from me

everything is so far away, theres no frame of reference


Kitty: TH3 can't save me now
Kitty: we'll have to bump it up to TH4
Kitty: ,,, it's not very funny
Kitty" i'm sorry



It's beautiful out here.
This is why i became an astronaut.
I wanted to be part of this.
Ive known for a long time i'd die out here. we talked about it
-> i was never scared of dying
-> i was scared for a while, but not anymore

-> thank you for being there when i needed you
-> i'm sorry i was always so distant
	i have trouble connecting with people
	just,,, i don't get people. i don;t know why they are the way they are, and i'ts not who i am
	i've always felt like an alien pretending to be human, and not doing a good job at it
	i guess i've finally come home. out in the stars
	see you later, Bardan. I'll always love you.
