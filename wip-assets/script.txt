Kitty: this is kitty

Boto: It works! So we can talk through this when you're on missions?

Kitty: i can send messages to yo, but phones arent meant to send messages into space

Kitty: *you 

Boto: Wait, so how are you receiving these?

Kitty: the reciever works on the ground

Kitty: but once we launch, the only way to send messages to us is by central command.

Boto: So once you're in space, you won't see any of these...

Kitty: Yeah.

Kitty: but i can send them. the transmitter's strong enough

Boto: That sucks.

Boto: I mean, it's nice that you can send updates,

Boto: But you know.

Kitty: if it makes you feel better, you can e-mail cencom and th3'

Kitty: they'll pass it along with their usual payload

Boto: It's something, at least.

Boto: Do you think they'll check for messages often?

Boto: Those guys didn't keep me in the loop before.

Boto: So i Don't know 

Kitty: you've got a point.  they could be slow to pass it on.
