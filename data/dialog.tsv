B	 It works! So we can talk through this when you're on missions?

K	i can send messages to yo, but phones arent meant to send messages into space

K	*you 

B	Wait, so how are you receiving these?

K	the reciever works on the ground

K	but once we launch, the only way to send messages to us is by central command.

B	So once you're in space, you won't see any of these...

K	Yeah.

K	but i can send them. the transmitter's strong enough

B	That sucks.

B	I mean, it's nice that you can send updates,

B	But you know.

K	if it makes you feel better, you can e-mail cencom and th3'

K	they'll pass it along with their usual payload

B	It's something, at least.

B	Do you think they'll check for messages often?

B	Those guys didn't keep me in the loop before.

B	So i Don't know 

K	you've got a point.  they could be slow to pass it on.
