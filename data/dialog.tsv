K	this is kitty

B	I hear you. So we can talk through this when you're on missions?

K	i can send messages to yo, but phones cant send messages into space
K	*you

B	But you're recieving them now?

K	it works on the ground
K	but once we Launch, its just the usual

B	So when you're in space, you won't see any of these

K	Yeah.
K	but i can send them. the transmitter's strong enough

B	That sucks.
B	Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely happy you can send updates
B	But you know. It's two steps forward, one step back.

K	you can still email cencom and th3'
K	they'll pass it along

B	TH3?

K	sorry, my fingers slipped
K	that was "they'll"

B	lol
B	I thought you were name-dropping some secret organization.

K	haha
K	its my spy network
K	they;l hook you up

B	That'd be better than going through Cencom, tbh.

K	theyre not so bad

B	They are. You know they are.

K	we should talk about this in private

B	Private? Can Cencom read these or something?

K	probably??

B	Ah hell. Sorry. Talk to you later.
