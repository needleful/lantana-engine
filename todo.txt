		Parenting objects to bones
			Mostly done.  Need a way to separate transforms from the matrix, though
			How do other games implement transforms?  Translation is pretty easy, but rotations could be way less precise without euler angles.
			I'll need to look into quaternions more.  They map to matrices pretty cleanly.
		Frame interpolation between animations?
		Different animations for different bones
			I'll need to separate animations from animated meshes.
			The mesh instance only cares about the bones.  It needs no awareness for how those bones are controlled.
			Maybe this is the time to create a generic animation system.  I could have each channel separated out as a list of values, and have the keyframes to interpolate between them.  Having animation channels could be much faster if they're templated, instead of the accessors currently in use.
