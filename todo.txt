- Design idea:

	Design the game as a series of libraries.
	Git submodules could be used, even.
	The division should be saved for later, but this would be the best of both worlds: make the engine general purpose and modular, but make sure that unique projects only bring in what they need, rather than trying to make some super-software that can build any possible game.  The focal systems (the game and the game-specific editors) would be coded for each project or modified from existing projects, but anything that really is general-purpose can be separated and used across projects.
	Each library could have branches for specific major versions to keep compatibility with old games, so they don't need to be constantly updated to newer versions of the engine to recieve patches etc.
